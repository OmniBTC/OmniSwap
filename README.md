# Overview

The original intention of OmniSwap is to achieve the purpose of **Omnichain** interoperability by aggregating the liquidity of various bridges.

With the help of OmniSwap:
1. Rapid circulation of user assets in different chains.
2. Aggregate different bridges such as **Stargate**, **Wormhole**, etc. Users have the best cross-chain experience, covering security, speed and fees.
3. Aggregate the swap of different chains, users can swap different assets of the two chains with one click, such as **ETH** of **Ethereum** and **BNB** of **BSC**.

# Supported

## Bridge

- [x] **[Stargate](https://stargate.finance/)**: Based on the [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) cross -chain message protocol, a single currency pool cross-chain bridge.
- [x] **[Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/)**: Wormhole is a universal interoperability protocol, xAsset allows tokens to circulate across chains.

## Chain

- [x] Ethereum
- [x] Bsc
- [x] Arbitrum
- [x] Optimism
- [x] Polygon
- [x] Avalanche
