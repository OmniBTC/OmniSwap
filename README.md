# Overview

The original intention of OmniSwap is to achieve the purpose of **Omnichain** interoperability by aggregating the liquidity of various bridges.

With the help of OmniSwap:
1. Rapid circulation of user assets in different chains.
2. Aggregate different bridges such as **Stargate**, **Wormhole**, etc. Users have the best cross-chain experience, covering security, speed and fees.
3. Aggregate the swap of different chains, users can swap different assets of the two chains with one click, such as **ETH** of **Ethereum** and **BNB** of **BSC**.
